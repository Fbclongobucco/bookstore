<h1>Project Bookstore</h1>
  
  <h4>This project creates an application that exposes an API emulating a simple online bookstore. It is a microservice that combines object-oriented concepts and a layered architecture, with access to databases. Additionally, it includes a queuing service for asynchronous jobs and a Spring Boot service. The latter will simulate a bank account service, serving as a reference for payment of purchases.</h4>
